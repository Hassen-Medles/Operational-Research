## Overview :
This project was developed as part of a CESI engineering school project by Zoé Izambert, Axel Calendreau, Hugo Battaglia, and Hassen Medles.
## Objective
We aim to model and solve a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a generalization of the classic Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), by considering real-world constraints such as:
- Delivery time windows
- Vehicle capacity
- Available road networks

The main objective is to minimize total travel distance or fuel consumption, while satisfying all logistical constraints.
